# üß† Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on MNIST

This repository contains a custom implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. The architecture and training procedure closely follow the original GAN paper by Ian Goodfellow et al., with a few practical improvements for training stability.

## üìå Overview

A GAN consists of two neural networks:
- **Generator**: Learns to map random noise vectors to plausible images.
- **Discriminator**: Learns to distinguish between real images (from the dataset) and fake images (produced by the generator).

These two models compete in a MiniMax game:
> The generator tries to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries not to be fooled.

This adversarial process helps the generator learn to create realistic images.

## üóÇÔ∏è Project Structure

- `1. Data Preprocessing`: Loads and normalizes MNIST dataset images to the range [-1, 1].
- `2. Model Definitions`: Custom classes for Generator, Discriminator, and GAN with modular and configurable architecture.
- `3. Training Setup`: Defines optimizers, loss functions, accuracy metrics, and image-saving callbacks.
- `4. Training Loop`: Trains the GAN for a user-defined number of epochs using a custom `train_step()`.

## üß± Architecture

### Generator
- Fully connected layers with increasing units.
- Uses `ReLU` activation and `BatchNormalization`.
- Final layer uses `sigmoid` to output pixel values between 0 and 1.
- Outputs reshaped to (28, 28, 1).

### Discriminator
- Fully connected layers with decreasing units.
- Uses `ReLU` and `Dropout` for regularization.
- Final layer uses `sigmoid` to predict real/fake probability.

### Training Strategy
- **Label Smoothing**: Applies soft labels to real/fake images to prevent overconfidence.
- **Multiple Generator Updates**: Trains the generator multiple times per discriminator step to balance convergence.
- **Accuracy Metric**: Custom discriminator accuracy metric included.
